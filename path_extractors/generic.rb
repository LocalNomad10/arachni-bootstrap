            # This extractor needs to be a tiny bit intelligent because
            # due to its generic nature it'll inevitably match some garbage.
            #
            # For example, if some JS code contains:
            #
            #    var = 'http://blah.com?id=1'
            #
            # or

            #    var = { 'http://blah.com?id=1', 1 }
            #
            #
            # The URI.extract call will match:
            #
            #    http://blah.com?id=1'
            #
            # and
            #
            #    http://blah.com?id=1',
            #
            # respectively.
